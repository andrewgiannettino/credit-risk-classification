Overview of the Analysis
In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

Explain the purpose of the analysis.

{The Pourpose of this analysis is to train and then evaluate the accuracy of a prediction model. This prediction model is to determine the risk factor of taking a loan from a peer to peer lending service.

Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.

{The financial information that the data was on was historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., value_counts).

{The variables I was trying to predict were Loan Status, loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, num of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt.

Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., LogisticRegression, or any other algorithms). 

{The methods I used were a logistic regression algorithim along with a confusion matrix.

Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Machine Learning Model 1:
Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores
       Accuracy Score: 99%
       Precision: 0[100%], 1[85%]
       Recall Scores: 0[99%], 1[91%]
       F1 Scores: 0[100%], 1[88%]
Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any:

Summary: I would recommend this model because of how accurate it was especially based on the healthy loans. It could use some more work to become accurate regarding the High Risk Loans. Even though the high risk loan is less accurate I would still reccomend because its still veryu accurate just less than the predictions for healthy loans. Overall I can confidntly reccomend this model.
